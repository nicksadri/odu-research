Participated in deep learning research at Old Dominion University, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. Presented at an IEEE conference and published work in conference proceedings as first author.

The end-product was a deep learning image enhancement model that could denoise digital copies of the Navy's shipbuilding blueprints. I am not permitted to publicize the model itself, but more details can be found in the published paper linked below.
